Its inexcusable for hvac blower units to ship in a cardboard box with a couple of thin foam sheets and the box is large enough for the part to move around during shipment. Parts packaged in this manner dont survive well in air and ground shipments.  Theres an additonal layer to this where the PDC employee should be cognizant that if the part they are packaging is going to be shipped cross country to package the part in a manner thats going to prevent the part from being damaged in transit.,H

Lastly, but most importantly, parts that have been returned to the PDC as new, unused parts more often than not come to me in absolutely horrific condition. Some of the boxes are held together with tape alone, where you can clearly see the part inside to closed box through the tape. This always leads me to question the integrity of the part, the dealership who returned it to the PDC, and the warehouse personnel who thought it a good idea to credit that dealership for the return and place it back on the shelf as usable stock.",K
